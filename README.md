# R-Programming-Group-Project

Situation: Iowa liquor sales from the beginning of 2019 until now

Data: Due to the size of the file, only the subset of the data is included in the repository.
This project will use data that is publicly available from the data.iowa.gov website. We plan to download data from the specified time period and load it into R. 
The CSV files contain data pertaining to the date the liquor was sold, regional information on the sale, quantity sold, and total sales amount in dollars from January 2019 until the most recent update.

Question: Our group would like to explore and answer, “Did the pandemic cause liquor sales to increase or decrease?”

Hypothesis: We suspect that there will be a large increase in the sale of liquor prior to the initial closing of businesses due to public hysteria. However, once the public realizes that the pandemic is here to stay, we expect there to be increased liquor sales overall.
